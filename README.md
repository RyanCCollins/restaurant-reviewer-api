![Restaurant Reviewer](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/cdn/blob/master/restaurant-reviewer/main.jpg?raw=true)


## Getting Started

A restaurant review application with a focus on accessibility. Accesses JSON files containing restaurant information (including name, a photograph, address, cuisine type and operating hours) as well as JSON files containing review information for each restaurant (name of reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating and comments). Includes an application header, and a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants (by cuisine, by location, etc). When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews are displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.

## About
